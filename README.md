# WEATHER PROJECT - Version 1 (6 August 2017)

## Task

We were asked to build a simple program in our first week of learning Ruby that would tell a person what to wear depending on the weather.

## Synopsis

The program asks the user whether they are male or female (which will lead to different results). Error checking was built into this, so that the user is required to enter either male or female. Afer this, they will be asked to enter in the temperature in celsius. The program checks to see if the answer is an integer - if it is not, then it will ask them to try again. The final results depend on whether the user is male/female and whether the temperature is below, greater than, or equal to 20 degrees celsius.
